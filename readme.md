TextformatterTwitterReplace
========================

V 1.0

This is a very simple text formatter that looks for @ and # and adds the appropriate links to twitter.

So, @profile will become http://www.twitter.com/profile
and #searchterm will become http://twitter.com/search?q=searchterm

This is based on a couple of lines of code from Jacob Tomlinson:
